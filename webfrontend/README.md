**Description:**
Job hunting shouldn’t mean juggling 10 tabs. This project brings **Naukri, Internshala, Glassdoor, Unstop, and more** into a single hub. Connect your accounts, update your resume/profile once, and push those changes across platforms with ease.

Built with **Express + React + JWT auth**, the project is open for contributors who want to shape the future of job applications. Whether you’re into full-stack dev, APIs, or integrations there’s a place for you here.

We’re building this as a collaborative platform where students and developers can experiment, learn, and solve a real world problem together. 
Let's Go !!!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
